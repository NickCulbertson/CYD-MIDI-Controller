## What You Need

- **ESP32-2432S028R (CYD)** - ~$15 from AliExpress/Amazon
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 support

## Installation

### 1. Add ESP32 Board Support
1. Go to `File` → `Preferences`
2. Add to "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
   ```
   https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
3. Go to `Tools` → `Board` → `Boards Manager`
4. Search "ESP32" and install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems"

### 2. Install Libraries
In Arduino IDE Library Manager, install:
- `TFT_eSPI` by Bodmer
- `XPT2046_Touchscreen` by Paul Stoffregen  
- `ESP32 BLE MIDI` by lathoub (if needed, part of the ESP32 Arduino Core)

### 3. Configure TFT_eSPI
Replace the `libraries/TFT_eSPI/User_Setup.h` with the `User_Setup.h` from the repo.

### 4. Upload Code
1. Clone this repo and open `CYD_MIDI_Controller.ino`
2. Select board: `ESP32 Dev Module`
3. Connect CYD and upload
(Lower Upload Speed to `115200` if the sketch isn't uploading)

### 5. Connect
1. Pair "CYD MIDI" via Bluetooth
2. Select as MIDI input in your DAW

## Troubleshooting

- **Upload Speed**: Lower it to `115200` if the sketch isn't uploading
- **Blank screen**: Check TFT_eSPI pin configuration
- **No touch**: Verify touchscreen library installation
- **No Bluetooth**: Restart device and re-pair
